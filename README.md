## Installing:
	git clone git@github.com:StanislavNikolov/NodeShooter.git
	cd NodeShooter
	npm install
	node server.js

## TODO:

* README.md  
* Load map from file.  
* Add env. vars with higher priority than the config file (none right now).  
* Auto performance tuner - when the server realises it can't keep up with the load, cut some corners
  where needed.  
* Document the communication protocol.
