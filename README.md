* README.md
* Load map from file.  
* Add env. vars with higher priority than the config file (none right now)  
* Auto performance tuner - when the server realises it can't keep up with the load, cut some corners
  where needed.  
* Document the communication protocol.  
* Change scoreboard. Maybe rewrite the current one, or replace it completely with html tables floating above the canvas.
